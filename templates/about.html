	<p>
	  I am a research scientist currently working in the Neurobiology Department of Harvard Medical School.  My wife and I live in Somerville, Massachusetts with two cantankerous cats and a soon-to-be-born baby.  I grew up on a wheat farm in western Kansas, and moved to the Boston area for graduate school.  I adore the expanse of the skies & plains of the Midwest as well as beauty of the shores & forests of New England.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I'm fascinated and driven by understanding how big ideas such as pattern, abstraction, & computation manifest in all aspects of our lives.  The order and diversity of the natural world is a source of constant delight and inspiration for me.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Outside of science, I enjoy photography, contemporary art, & music of all sorts.  I am an enthusiastic cyclist (road, mountain and cyclocross) and ride for the <a href="http://www.broadwaybicycleracing.com">Broadway Bicycle School / Igleheart Frames Racing Team</a>.
