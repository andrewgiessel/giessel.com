	<p>
	  I am a research scientist currently working in the Neurobiology Department of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts.  My wife and I live with two cantankerous cats and a soon-to-be-born baby.  I grew up on a wheat farm in western Kansas, and moved to the Boston area for graduate school.  I adore the expanse of the skies & plains of the Midwest as well as beauty of the shores & forests of New England.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I am fascinated and driven by understanding how big ideas such as pattern, abstraction, and computation manifest in all aspects of our lives.  The order and diversity of the natural world is a source of constant delight and inspiration for me.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I've been a computer nerd from the instant I first saw a Commodore 64.  These days my language of choice is Python (which is what this site is written in). A good portion of this site is dedicated to sharing my experiences using computer programming in my work.
	</p>

	<p>
	  Outside of science, I enjoy photography, as well as contemporary art & music of all sorts.  I am an enthusiastic cyclist (road, mountain and cyclocross) and ride for the <a href="http://www.broadwaybicycleracing.com">Broadway Bicycle School / Igleheart Frames Racing Team</a>.
