title: Blog update!
published: 2015-10-26

Blog update!  I am a Data Scientist now, and have been for almost a year.  Overall the transition has been wonderful, and I am happy with my new career path.  I work at [Sense Ai](http://senseai.io), where we are using cutting edge techniques to standardize and generate novel sensors for mobile devices.  Our first major product is called Kelvin Sense, and turns mobile devices into thermometers with no additional hardware.  I am hard at work building new sensors and data products from these crowd sourced sensor streams.

This space has been incredibly quiet over the last couple of years.  Turns out having two young children really cuts into your free writing time!  Here's hoping I can keep something going.
